    "text": "Summary\nThe study is intended to summarize the patterns of when and where the aliens tend to visit US in the last century. The data we used is from Kaggle but is originally collected from NUFORC data by Sigmond Axel. From our study, we found that US is growing in popularity among the aliens as a vacation destination in the recent years. They prefer to visit California, Florida, and Washtington during their stays. However, the technology they used remain relatively unchanged, which is suggested by the consistentency in the duration of sightings. Therefore, for those who want to make friends with aliens, here is the chance."
